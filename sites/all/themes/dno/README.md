# Frontstrap: A nice starting theme

## Get started

1. $ drush dl sasson
2. Check out your theme settings page for layout and grid settings, development settings, SASS settings and more. Much more info in Sasson's README.txt
3. Here is a cute kitten: http://goo.gl/SVyem


## Style test
1. Make a basic page in Drupal using Full HTML, and paste the content of bootstrap-html.txt
2. Repeat with drupal-html.txt

## Todos
- Make sure the style tests above look good; need to be more specific in the (bootstrap) css to override. Still easier than overriding HTML.
- Implement jQuery UI bootstrap theme http://addyosmani.github.com/jquery-ui-bootstrap/ Scrap the non-jQuery bootstrap js.
- Make nice login
