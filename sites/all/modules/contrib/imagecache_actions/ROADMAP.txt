Imagecache Actions roadmap
--------------------------

This is a non-contractual roadmap for the D7 branch of the imagecache actions
module. Actual release dates and completed features will largely depend on
available time. So support is always welcome. Furthermore, critical bugs may
make us release more often, but that should only change the release number in
which certain features are planned, not the timeline.


Imagecache Actions 7.x-1.0
--------------------------
Targeted release date: may 2012

- Clean up D7 issue queue
- Commit posted patches from the issue queue
- Solve easy to solve bug reports
- Do some basic testing
- Reintroduce the text action, currently living in a sandbox project at
  http://drupal.org/node/1090312
- Update README.txt
- Introduce CHANGELOG.txt
- Add this ROADMAP.txt


Imagecache Actions 7.x-1.1
--------------------------
Targeted release date: summer 2012

- Check hook_help
- Solve remaining outstanding bug reports
- Keep D7 issue queue clean
- Improve Imagemagick support
- Check that all effects implement all of the effects API (especially the
  dimensions passthrough or not)
- Add testing. The idea is to create a set of image styles that cover all
  effects and can be used to visually check for regressions.

  Automated testing would be nice, but I am not sure that we can guarantee that
  jpeg or png files are binary identical on each run across different computers.
  But if the number of false positives is small, it would certainly be a useful
  addition.


Imagecache Actions 7.x-1.2
--------------------------
Targeted release date: end of 2012

- Look at outstanding feature requests
- Continue to keep the D7 issue queue clean
- Keep improving Imagemagick support, a.o:
  - Try to get insight into what version of imagemagick is required by what
    effect.
  - Document which effects might produce different results.
- Refactor code
  - Extract common form fields
  - Extract common error handling
  - Clean up comments, todo's, etc.
  - Doxygen code documentation according to latest standards
  - Increase the amount of lazy loaded code


Imagecache Actions 7.x-2.x
--------------------------
Targeted release date: ...

- Can we refactor effects into auto loading class based plugins? What does CTools
  offer in these?
- If so, will it make implementing new effects much simpler? Because that is
  what we should strive for.
- Should we rename the module to image_effects?
- If we manage to provide an easy to use plugin system, we should strive to merge
  with other modules that provide effects:
  - FiltersIE module (http://drupal.org/project/filtersie)
  - Imagecache Effects: http://drupal.org/project/imagecache_effects (D6 only, but
    are their effects more advanced then our counterparts or do they add new
    effects?)
  - Image watermark: http://drupal.org/project/watermark (D5 only, but is their
    watermark effect more advanced?)
  - ImageCache Scale-9 Actions: http://drupal.org/project/imagecache_scale9actions
  - etc.
